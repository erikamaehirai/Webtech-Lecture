<h1>SERVLETS</h1>

<h2>What are Servlets?</h2>
<p> Servlets are Java Programs thay sits in a server and when a request comes, it will come into play.
	Servlets are mapped into the a URL.</p>
	
<h2>Servlets Advantages to Common Gateway Interface</h2>
	<ol>
        <li>Performance is significantly better.</li>
		<li>Servlets execute within the address space of a Web server. It is not necessary to create a separate process to handle each client request.</li>
		<li>Servlets are platform-independent because they are written in Java.</li>
		<li>Java security manager on the server enforces a set of restrictions to protect the resources on a server machine. So servlets are trusted.</li>
		<li>The full functionality of the Java class libraries is available to a servlet. It can communicate with applets, databases, or other software via the sockets and RMI mechanisms that you have seen already.</li>

    </ol>

<h2>Servlets Packages</h2>
	<p> Servlets can be created using the <strong> javax.servlet</strong> and <strong>javax.servlet.http packages</strong> , which are a standard part of the Java's enterprise edition, an expanded version of the Java class library that supports large-scale development projects.
    </p>

<h2>Servlets Tasks</h2>
<h3>Servlets can perform the following major tasks:</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Send the implicit HTTP response to the clients (browsers).</li>
    <li>Send the explicit data (i.e., the document) to the clients (browsers) </li>             
    <li> Read the explicit data sent by the clients (browsers)</li>           
    <li>Read the implicit HTTP request data sent by the clients (browsers) </li>           
    <li>Process the data and generate the results </li>             
 </ol>
