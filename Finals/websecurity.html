<h1> OWASP </h1>
<p> The Opwn WEb Application Security Project (OWASP) is an
open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that
can be trusted.</p>


<h2>Changes between 2013 to 2017 Editions</h2>
<p>The T10 is organized around major risk areas, and they are not intended to be airtight, non-overlapping, or a strict
taxonomy. Some of them are organized around the attacker, some the vulnerability, some the defense, and some the
asset. Organizations should consider establishing initiatives to stamp out these issues.

<h2> OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risk - 2017 </h2>
<table>
	<th>OWASP Top 10</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A1 - Injection</Strong></td>
		<td>Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, XXE, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an
		interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter
		into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A2 - Broken Authentication and
							Session Management</Strong></td>
		<td>Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented
		incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit
		other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities (temporarily or permanently).
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A3 - Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)</Strong></td>
		<td>XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without
		proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user supplied data using a
		browser API that can create JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s
		browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A4 - Broken Access Control</Strong></td>
		<td>Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced. Attackers
		can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other
		users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A5 - Security Misconfiguration</Strong> </td>
		<td>Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application,
		frameworks, application server, web server, database server, platform, etc. Secure settings
		should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally,
		software should be kept up to date.
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure</Strong> </td>
		<td>Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial,
		healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit
		card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as
		encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A7 - Insufficient Attack Protection</Strong> </td>
		<td>The majority of applications and APIs lack the basic ability to detect, prevent, and respond to
		both manual and automated attacks. Attack protection goes far beyond basic input validation
		and involves automatically detecting, logging, responding, and even blocking exploit attempts.
		Application owners also need to be able to deploy patches quickly to protect against attacks.
	</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF) </Strong> </td>
		<td>A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the
		victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a
		vulnerable web application. Such an attack allows the attacker to force a victim’s browser to
		generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities </Strong> </td>
		<td>Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same
		privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate
		serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known
		vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><strong> A10 - Underprotected APIs </Strong> </td>
		<td>Modern applications often involve rich client applications and APIs, such as JavaScript in the
		browser and mobile apps, that connect to an API of some kind (SOAP/XML, REST/JSON, RPC,
		GWT, etc.). These APIs are often unprotected and contain numerous vulnerabilities.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<h1> HASHING</h1>
		<p>Producing hash values for accessing data or for security. A hash value (or simply hash), also called a message digest, is a number generated from a string of text. The hash is substantially smaller 
		than the text itself, and is generated by a formula in such a way that it is extremely unlikely that some other text will produce the same hash value.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Hashes play a role in security systems where they're used to ensure that transmitted messages have not been tampered with. The sender generates a hash of the message,
		encrypts it, and sends it with the message itself. The recipient then decrypts both the message and the hash, produces another hash from the received message,
		and compares the two hashes. If they're the same, there is a very high probability that the message was transmitted intact.</p>
	<h2>What is password hashing?</h2>
		<p>Hash algorithms are one way functions. They turn any amount of data into a fixed-length "fingerprint" that cannot be reversed. They also have the property that if the input changes by even a tiny bit,
		the resulting hash is completely different (see the example above). This is great for protecting passwords, because we want to store passwords in a form that protects them even if the password file itself
		is compromised, but at the same time, we need to be able to verify that a user's password is correct.</p>

	<h2> Adding Salt </h2>
		<p>The salt does not need to be secret. Just by randomizing the hashes, lookup tables, reverse lookup tables, and rainbow tables become ineffective. An attacker won't know in advance what the salt will be,
		so they can't pre-compute a lookup table or rainbow table. If each user's password is hashed with a different salt, the reverse lookup table attack won't work either.</p>
