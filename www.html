	<h1> World Wide Web </h1>
                <p> The World Wide Web contains information and is capable of sharing it over to the ones who are able to access it. <br>
This can be done over the access of the Internet. In here, it will share information about particularly any topic that has been collected and could be
 translated in how you want it to be. <br>

It uses the HTTP protocol to be able to transmit data. The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows the 
exchanging of business logic by letting applications communicate with each other and they are able to share information through the use of the Web.<br>

 The Web does not only contain text documents of information but these documents could contain graphics, sounds, and videos.<br>
 It uses browsers like the Internet Explorer of Firefox for the purpose of accessing information from Web Pages that are supposed to be linked to each other
 with the use of hyperlinks. <br>

The World Wide Web that is accessed over the use of the Internet has become the main source to our everyday working life 
because we rely on the internet for references that is related or could be of help to our work. <br>People need to do some research in order to understand 
or get more information about the work they are doing to be able to accomplish it. They should have enough or some advanced knowledge in order to be 
successful in doing their work with the right resources. </p>
