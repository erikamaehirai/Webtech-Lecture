What is CSS?
-Cascading Style Shee or CSS is a language used to specify the presentation aspects of structurally marked up documents.
-It is also used to format the colors,fonts, and backgrounds of html files.
-It is developed by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.

Versions of CSS:
CSS 1
CSS 2
CSS 2.1

I. CSS Statements
-a statement in CSS is either an at-rule or rule set.

At-Rules

The @charset at-rule can be used to specify the character encoding of an external style sheet. It must appear before anything else in the file.

The @import at-rule allows us to import one style sheet into another. All @import at-rules must appear before any rules.

The @media at-rule lets us target rules to the media types we specify.

The @page at-rule can be used to specify margins for paged media. You can set different margins for left- and right-hand pages when you’re printing double-sided pages, as well as for the first page.

The @font-face at-rule allows us to specify custom fonts.

The @namespace at-rule in CSS3 lets us declare an XML namespace, as well as an optional prefix with which that namespace can be specified.

The @document CSS at-rule restricts the style rules contained within it based on the URL of the document.

The @keyframes CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence.
